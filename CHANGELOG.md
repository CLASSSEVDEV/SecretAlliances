## Mod Philosophy

This overhaul transforms Secret Alliances from a simple alliance mod into a **comprehensive political simulation** that rivals real-world political complexity:

### Real-World Politics Elements
1. **Influence Trading**: Like lobbying and political favors
2. **Economic Warfare**: Like sanctions and trade wars
3. **Espionage**: Like intelligence agencies and spy operations
4. **Backroom Deals**: Like secret negotiations
5. **Political Betrayals**: Like shifting alliances in geopolitics
6. **Reputation Management**: Like public opinion and diplomatic standing

### Strategic Depth
- Multiple paths to power (military, economic, diplomatic, espionage)
- Risk/reward balance in all actions
- Long-term strategic planning required
- Dynamic world that reacts to player actions
- AI creates unpredictable political landscape

---

## Future Expansion Possibilities

While the mod is now feature-complete, potential future additions could include:

### Potential Enhancements
- Marriage alliance mechanics (using existing framework)
- Territory agreements and border conflicts
- Cultural influence and soft power
- Propaganda and information warfare
- Diplomatic crises and emergency summits
- Alliance ranking and prestige system
- Covert operations in neutral territory
- Economic sanctions enforcement
- Intelligence sharing networks

---

## Testing & Balance

### Recommended Testing Focus
1. **UI Integration**: Verify clan menu button opens alliance manager
2. **Diplomacy**: Test agreement creation and expiry
3. **Economic**: Test embargo effects on prosperity
4. **Espionage**: Test spy network establishment and operations
5. **AI Behavior**: Observe NPCs using new systems
6. **Save/Load**: Verify all systems persist correctly

### Balance Notes
- All costs calibrated for mid-game clans (500+ strength)
- Influence regenerates naturally based on power
- Reputation recovers slowly (prevents permanent damage)
- Spy networks are expensive but powerful
- Coordinated alliance attacks are devastating but costly
