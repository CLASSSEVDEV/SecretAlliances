## Installation

1. Extract to your Bannerlord Modules folder: `Mount & Blade II Bannerlord/Modules/SecretAlliances/`
2. Enable the mod in the launcher
3. Start a new campaign or load an existing save

**Compatibility**: Bannerlord v1.2.9, .NET Framework 4.7.2

## Usage Guide

### Creating Secret Alliances

1. Talk to a clan leader and select diplomatic options
2. Choose "I'd like to discuss a... private arrangement between our clans"
3. The AI will evaluate based on:
   - Your relationship with the clan leader
   - Power balance between clans
   - Current political situation
   - Leader personality traits

### Managing Alliances

- **View Status**: Talk to allied clan leaders to check trust levels, secrecy, and recent activities
- **Request Assistance**: Ask for help with battles, raids, or other needs
- **Leave Alliance**: End arrangements that no longer serve your interests
- **Monitor Exposure**: Watch for rumors and leaks that might compromise your secrets

### Battle Assistance (No More Kingdom Switching!)

The new system works as follows:
1. When allies are in battle, you may receive assistance requests
2. Accepting provides **covert support** without changing your kingdom
3. Your assistance affects battle outcomes while maintaining your allegiance
4. Risk of exposure depends on battle size, location, and witnesses
5. Consequences (if discovered) include relationship penalties, not forced exile

### AI Behavior

AI clans make decisions based on:
- **Strategic Value**: Military strength, economic benefits, territorial advantages
- **Relationships**: Personal bonds between leaders
- **Personality Traits**: Honor affects betrayal likelihood, Calculating affects alliance formation
- **Circumstances**: Wars, financial pressure, recent events
- **Risk Assessment**: Exposure probability, political consequences

## Console Commands (for debugging)

- `sa.dumpAlliances` - Show all active alliances
- `sa.listIntel` - Display intelligence/leak information
- `sa.forceLeaks [alliance]` - Trigger leak for testing

## Technical Details

### Architecture

The mod uses a clean, modular architecture:
