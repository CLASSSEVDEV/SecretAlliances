# Secret Alliances Mega Feature Expansion - Implementation Summary

This implementation delivers the complete Secret Alliances gameplay layer as specified in the problem statement, incorporating all features from former PRs 2-7 plus additional enhancements.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Adaptive Trade & Financial Intelligence (Former PR 2)
- ✅ Disparity-driven economic flow based on wealth gaps
- ✅ Financial intel generation with severity proportional to transfer impact  
- ✅ Secrecy erosion & trust scaling by transaction magnitude percentile
- ✅ Anti-exploit throttling (3+ high transfers in 10 days blocked)
- ✅ Volatility bands and reserve floor protection

### 2. Coalition Cohesion & Group Dynamics (Former PR 3)
- ✅ Daily cohesion metric: 0.6 * avgStrength + 0.4 * avgSecrecy
- ✅ Cohesion buffs for strength and controlled secrecy decay
- ✅ Group strength/secrecy caches for AI recruitment decisions
- ✅ Coalition recruitment AI targeting desperate/complementary clans
- ✅ Automatic recruitment intelligence generation

### 3. Defection & Betrayal Instrumentation (Former PR 4)
- ✅ Complete factor breakdown logging (JSON-style single line)
- ✅ PreBattleDefection vs StrategicDefection distinction
- ✅ 30-day cooldown after successful defection
- ✅ Betrayal risk escalator (10% increment per near-miss, capped at 50%)
- ✅ Player notifications for high betrayal probability scenarios

### 4. Operations Framework (Former PR 5)
- ✅ Full PendingOperationType enum (CovertAid, SpyProbe, RecruitmentFeelers, SabotageRaid, CounterIntelligenceSweep)
- ✅ 7-day operation scheduler with adaptive timing (political pressure & trust thresholds)
- ✅ Complete execution outcomes for all operation types
- ✅ Risk model: operationDifficulty vs (Trust + Strength synergy + Leader skills)
- ✅ Failure severity influences secrecy loss and leak generation
- ✅ Operation-specific cooldown matrix (5-14 days per type)

### 5. Player-Facing UI & Rumor Gating (Former PR 6)
- ✅ ShouldShowRumorOption requires shared alliance or coalition membership
- ✅ Enhanced TryGetRumorsForHero with proper filtering (player clan involvement + hero clan match)
- ✅ Intelligence ranking: reliability * aging factor * category weights
- ✅ Category weights: Coup 1.25x, Military 1.15x, Financial 1.1x, etc.
- ✅ Up to 3 formatted rumor snippets
- ✅ Localized string tokens prepared for translation pipeline

### 6. Balancing & Polishing (Former PR 7)
- ✅ Daily change clamps (5% max per day for trust/strength/secrecy)
- ✅ Leak probability smoothing curve (modified logistic function)
- ✅ Anti-runaway logic: Strength > 90% + Secrecy < 25% = forced reveal risk
- ✅ Bribe influence soft-capped in alliance formation
- ✅ Self-diagnostics on first daily tick with aggregate statistics

### 7. Additional Enhancements Beyond Original Roadmap
- ✅ Alliance Visibility Hints with suspicion pip system
- ✅ Espionage Cooldown Matrix preventing operation spam
- ✅ Influence Tie-In converting high-strength alliances to diplomatic proposals
- ✅ Config System with JSON auto-generation and safe fallbacks
- ✅ Debug Console Commands (sa.dumpAlliances, sa.forceLeak, etc.)
- ✅ Enhanced intelligence categorization (10 types total)
- ✅ Financial intelligence system with magnitude percentile tracking
- ✅ Coalition expansion mechanics via RecruitmentFeelers operations

## Technical Implementation Details

### Configuration System
- SecretAlliancesConfig.cs with JSON serialization using System.Text.Json
- Auto-generation of config file with all tweakable constants
- Safe fallback values if config loading fails

### Enhanced Data Structures  
- 38 saveable fields in SecretAllianceRecord (backward compatible)
- 9 saveable fields in AllianceIntelligence
- New enums: PendingOperationType, extended AllianceIntelType
- Category weights dictionary for intelligence scoring

### Operations Framework
- 5 distinct operation types with unique execution logic
- Risk-based success calculation using clan capabilities
- Cooldown bitmask system for operation throttling
- Adaptive scheduling based on political pressure and trust

### Intelligence & Rumors
- Enhanced filtering requiring alliance relationships
- Multi-factor scoring with aging and category weights
- Localized string tokens for future translation
- Player-clan-centric intelligence gathering

### Balancing Systems
- Leak probability smoothing using logistic curves
- Daily change clamping to prevent runaway effects
- Anti-exploit mechanisms in trade and operations
- Force-reveal mechanics for overpowered secret alliances

### Quality of Life Features
- Comprehensive debug logging with factor breakdowns
- Self-diagnostics printing system statistics
- Player notifications for important events
- Console commands for testing and debugging

## Files Modified/Added

- ✅ SecretAllianceBehavior.cs - Enhanced with all new systems (~3000 lines)
- ✅ SecretAllianceRecord.cs - Extended data structures and enums  
- ✅ SecretAlliancesConfig.cs - New configuration system
- ✅ SubModule.cs - Updated rumor UI integration
- ✅ SecretAlliances.csproj - Added config file reference

## Integration Points

The implementation integrates seamlessly with:
- Mount & Blade II campaign events (daily ticks, battles, diplomacy)
- Existing dialogue system via enhanced rumor conditions
- Save/load system via extended SyncData
- Player notifications and UI feedback
- Debug console for developer testing

## Future Extensibility

The architecture supports easy extension via:
- JSON configuration for all balance parameters
- Modular operation types in enum-driven framework
- Localized string token system for multi-language support
- Event-driven intelligence generation system
- Pluggable debug commands for testing

All features have been implemented with minimal changes to existing working code, following the principle of surgical, precise modifications while delivering the complete mega feature expansion as specified.
